            <div class="Matter-About">
                Hi, I am Anubhav. I am working in IT industry since 2019 and currently working as a Software developer
                although I have worked as an Quality Assurance Automation Engineer, an Application Engineer, as an SQL
                query developer as well.
                My current role allows me to work as both front end and beck end developer using ASP .NET MVC. As my
                career path till now is a mixture of both functional and technical roles, it boosts my working abilities
                as a techno functional guy. I contribute myself in making wireframes or other functional-technical
                decisions.
                Apart from official work, I have also a basic knowledge of desktop app development in VB .NET.
                I started my career as a QA Engineer in E-Connectsolutions Pvt Ltd, There I contribute my part in
                creating a GUI based Automation tool for shooting test cases and generating test reports. I worked as an
                Automation test designer and script writer in Robot Framework.
                After this I worked as an Application Engineer in the same company, I got to work with a different team
                in this new role, my role was to gather information from the client about the new requirements and
                current difficulties in the product of our company, discuss them to the team and find out the solution
                and fill the information in the brains of the developers. I worked as a functional tester too in this
                role, did testing of the changes in the product and also did the management and manipulation of data
                through SQL, I got to practice my SQL skills in this role. I used my Automation skills in this role too
                by automating the processes for manipulating the huge amount of data.
                Then I also got to work on Peoplesoft software, in this role I got to build a bit more challenging SQL
                queries.
                Currently I am working as a dot net developer in the same organization.
                In a nutshell, I have:
                - Experience in software logic development and problem solving.
                - Experience in Automation Testing and Functional testing.
                - Understanding of Test case designing and writing.
                - Capability of writing Python Scripts, Automation Scripts and SQL queries.
